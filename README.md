To use this you will need to create a csv file named "answers.csv" which will act as the brain of the code. Next, you will need to create an entry into the csv file:
Let the numbers be the column numbers(0 being the first column):
0 : Who are you?  1 : My name is Jonathon

I would recommend that the first question be the one shown above. No particular reason he is just called Jonathon.

Hope you enjoy. Thanks.
